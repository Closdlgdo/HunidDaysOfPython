# a for loop is used to iterate over a list of objects.

for obj in [0, 1, 2]:
    print("Carlos")

# to make the top code usable with higher values, we need to add a new function called "range"
# this function allows us to give a starting point and a stop point.
for obj in range(33):
    print("delgado")

# another way to print this in the simplest way is:
print("Carlos\n" * 3, end="")
