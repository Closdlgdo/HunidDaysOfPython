# You can use a lambda function within a list comprehension to perform more complex operations on elements.
# Example: Squaring each element in a list using a lambda function within a list comprehension
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_nums = [lambda x: x ** 2 for x in nums]

# Example: Filtering even numbers using a lambda function within a list comprehension
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_nums = [x for x in nums if lambda x: x % 2 == 0]

# Example: Mapping a function to each element using a lambda function within a list comprehension
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mapped_nums = [lambda x: x * 2 for x in nums]

# Example: Suppose you want to create a list of squared numbers for even numbers in a range.
# Using a list comprehension with a lambda function
squared_evens = [(lambda x: x ** 2)(num) for num in range(10) if num % 2 == 0]

# In summary, list comprehensions are primarily used for creating lists based on existing iterables, while lambda
# functions are used for short, anonymous operations. They can be combined when you need a concise way to apply a quick
# operation to elements in a list.
