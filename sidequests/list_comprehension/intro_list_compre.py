# We will be learning about list comprehensions in python.
# What is a list comprehension? List comprehension in Python is a way to create a new list from an existing one, but
# with some modifications. Itâ€™s like a shortcut for creating lists.
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
strings = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]

# result = [] # This is a traditional python for-loop
# for i in nums:
#     i *= 2
#     print("i: ", i)  # this will show us how the loop iterates through our list.
#     result.append(i)

# var = [i * 2 for i in nums] # Using a list comprehension allows us to shorten this for-loop into a single line.
#
# print(var)

# results = []
# for i in strings:
#     i = i.upper()  # Here we are iterating over our list and changing each element to uppercase.
#     results.append(i)
# results = [i.upper() for i in strings]
#
# print(results)
#
# # A key feature to list comprehensions is that they return lists.
# # We can also add conditional statements to our list comprehensions.
# iterating = [i * 2 for i in [1, 2, 3, 4]]
# print(iterating)

# We use list comprehension with functions too.


# def timesFour(num):
#     return num * 4
#
#
# # result = []  # we create a new list called result.
# # for i in nums:
# #     i = timesFour(i)  # First, we use the function timesFour to change the value of i.
# #     print('i: ', i)
# #     result.append(i)  # Then, we append the result to our list.
#
# new_result = [timesFour(i) for i in nums]
#
# print(new_result)

# Last example is we can use it with a dictionary.
dicts = [{'a': 13302, 'b': 23042, 'c': 34039}]
# we will grab the values of the dictionary and put them in a list.
# results = []
# for i in dicts:
#     results.append(i['a'])

results = [i['a'] for i in dicts]

print(results)
