# Exercise 1: Simple Math Operations
# Write a Python program that:
#
# Takes two numbers as input from the user.
x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
y = int(input("Enter another number: "))
# Calculates and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
summation = x + y
difference = x - y
product = x * y
quotient = x / y

print("Sum:", summation, "Difference:", difference, "Product:", product, "Quotient:", quotient)
