# Today we are learning about list comprehensions. A list comprehension is a way to create a new list with less syntax.
# Example:
# a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# new_list = [new_item for item in list]
# Without list comprehensions:
# new_list = []
# for item in a_list:
#     new_list.append(item)
# print(new_list)
# With list comprehensions:
# new_list = [new_item for item in a_list]
# print(new_list)
